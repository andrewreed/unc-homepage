<p><h1>My Open Source Projects</h1></p>
<p>The following programs are currently under development. I will upload them to GitHub once I have completed my research. Since my degree is being funded by the US Government, there will be no copyright associated with these programs.</p>
<p><b>dashem</b><br />
A lightweight DASH emulator that can replicate a Netflix-like architecture and generate adaptive traffic from any number of distributed clients that are streaming "real movies". This emulator will be suitable for use in storage-limited environments such as <a href="http://www.geni.net/">GENI</a>.</p>
<p><b>dashmon</b><br />
A program that monitors a network interface (to include a DAG card acting as a passive tap) for live DASH streams. DASH streams are reported as they are identified. This programs relies on <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jeffay/papers/TMA-09.pdf">adudump</a> for input.</p>
<p><b>DASH Detective</b><br />
A Hadoop program that analyzes <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jeffay/papers/TMA-09.pdf">adudump</a> logs and reports statistics relevant to our DASH Traffic Model.</p>
