<p><b><a href="https://github.com/andrewreed/dashem">dashem</a></b><br />
A lightweight DASH client emulator that can replicate a Netflix-like architecture and generate adaptive traffic from any number of distributed clients that are streaming "real movies". This emulator is suitable for use in storage-limited environments such as <a href="http://www.geni.net/">GENI</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://github.com/andrewreed/profiler">profiler</a></b><br />
A utility that generates profiles of DASH videos from Netflix and Amazon that can be used by dashem.</p>
<p><b>dashid</b><br />
A Hadoop program that analyzes anonymized, header-only (i.e. payload-truncated) packet traces and reports HTTP connections that match DASH video fingerprints. Note that traces are first processed by <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jeffay/papers/TMA-09.pdf">adudump</a>. I will upload dashid to GitHub once I am done with my research.</p>
